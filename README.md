### Gameplay & Controls
#### Game modes
The game has two game modes: Time Attack and Duel.

In Time Attack, your objective is to finish a 2km (1.24 miles) sprint as fast
as you can. Your best time will be saved.

In Duel, you will face a computer opponent. Beat him to the finish line over
the same 2km sprint. If you win the race, your best time lead will be saved.
Your total win count will also be saved.

You can see your current records on the main menu screen.
#### Controls
There are two difficulty levels in the game: Easy & Hard.
##### Easy Controls
In this mode the transmission is semi-automatic (and a bit low-tech, too).

The right action button controls the acceleration.

The left action button is the clutch. While you keep it pressed, you can use
the Joystick/D-PAD Up/Down to shift to a new gear. The gear selector will be displayed
while you're holding the button. After you shift to a new gear, release
the clutch button and press the right action button to accelerate (you can hold
the acceleration button while the clutch button is being pressed, it will not do
anything).

##### Hard Controls
In this mode the transmission is fully manual.

The right action button controls the acceleration.

The left action button is the clutch. While you keep it pressed, you can use
the Joystick/D-PAD Up/Down/Left/Right to shift to a new gear. The gear selection will be
displayed while you're holding the button. After you shift to a new gear,
release the clutch button and press the right action button to accelerate (or you
can keep it pressed while holding the clutch button, the RPM will not increase while
the clutch button is pressed).

In both control modes, you need to keep holding the clutch button until the
gear shift animation finishes (it's only 2-3 frames), otherwise you'll
break your gearbox (and you'll lose the race). There is a red indicator which
stays on while the gear is still shifting, so you'll be able to avoid such
disasters.

#### Managing your RPM
If the engine goes over a certain RPM, a warning indicator will be displayed.
The indicator will gradually fill up, if it gets to 100%, you engine will
explode and you'll lose the race. You need to shift to a higher gear or release
the acceleration button in order to allow the engine to cool off (1930s
technology right here!). In higher gears, the engine will overheat much faster.

The current RPM is indicated by a bar on your HUD.

### TODO list
* Support imperial units - currently, all units are metric.
* Indicator to show race progress (simple minimap).
* Sound
